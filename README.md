# SpotDash

## Description

SpotDash is a web application built using Flask that simplifies the frustration of finding parking lots near you. It consists of three main modules: User, Managers, and Admin.

- **User Module:** Users can create an account and log in to access the user page, where they can find a list of parking lots within a specific radius of their location.

- **Managers Module:** Parking area owners can create accounts as managers. They can upload images of their parking areas and use Mask R-CNN to detect available parking spaces. Additionally, managers can detect space availability from video using OpenCV.

- **Admin Module:** The admin has control over verifying manager accounts and manages user accounts.

## Installation

To run SpotDash locally, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.7
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Mask R-CNN (Refer to [Mask R-CNN GitHub Repo](https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN))
- OpenCV
- Streamlit
- Flask
- TailwindCSS
- Sqlite3 (Database)

For enhanced performance (GPU support), use `tensorflow-gpu` if you have a compatible GPU.

### Download Mask R-CNN Model

Download the Mask R-CNN model from [this link](https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN/releases/download/v2.0/mask_rcnn_coco.h5) and place it in the appropriate directory.

## Usage

" flask run " (to run flask application[users and managers])
" streamlit run app.py " (to run streamlit application[Admin only])

## Features

SpotDash offers the following key features:

- User Module:
  - Create an account and log in.
  - Get a list of parking lots within a specific radius.
  - View parking areas on the main page map.
  - Filter the map to scale up to 10km radius.
  - Select a parking area to view available and occupied spaces.
  - Obtain Google Maps directions to selected parking areas.

- Managers Module:
  - Create an account as a parking area manager.
  - Account activation after admin verification and approval.
  - Log in and add parking details.
  - Upload images of parking areas to detect available parking spaces.
  - Detect occupied spaces (car, motorcycle, or truck) from images.
  - Update parking space status for users to see.
  - Manually mark spaces in videos for detection and update.

- Admin Module:
  - Use Streamlit to manage admin and manager accounts.
  - Approve manager accounts for activation.
  - Get a visualized view of user data.
